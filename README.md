# This is my Learn JS project.

The purpose of this project is to track and share my learning about JavaScript including

1. Defining of What, Why and How of each thing in JS
2. Sharing some ideas and concepts for learning and development.
3. Making lists of things to involve with includes doing, making, learning.
4. Talking about anything around JS in related subjects and related contexts.

To make sure that this repository will be useful and help anyone who came here to learn faster in JavaScript 
I will firstly trying a lot before committing anything to the repository.

I will work with this project by session (which will be 2 hours block of time)
I was intended to involved with it at least an hour everyday (Half session)
And commit updates before midnight everyday.

Some test will be fork first and commit to master later.
Some will not be commit as it's a long term test or parallel testing.

by the way this is not intended to be tutorials or something.
I just want to make a learning step for programming, refine it and share to you all.

## This project will contains of 
- Text noted as Markdown as .md file
- Source JavaScript file named by purpose (Use my naming system which will update alogn with [Learning tree](LEARNING-TREE.md) )
- Display of JavaScript test with HTML and other appropriate way.
- Some images and css.


## Important notes will contain in the repository root directory
- **README.md** (This file) will contained description of this project
> Update occasionally when I have something new and important about on the project

- **[OVERVIEW.md](OVERVIEW.md)** will contained overall details of this project to make it easy find and see the progression.
> Update everyday

- **[STACK.md](STACK.md)** will contained the list of to-do things on JavaScript.
> Update many times a day after I skim through any interesting JS learning materials or it just catch my eyes.

- **[LEARNING-TREE.md](LEARNING-TREE.md)** will contained view for learning hierarchy.
> Update everyday at the late of my session.

- **[LOGS.md](LOGS.md)** will contained anything I just did with the project.

## Directory Structure
There are 3 main style of directory naming.

1. Folders with All Capital Letters mean to have some specific reason
2. Folders with Capital the first letter
3. Folders with all small letters mean


- **/** - root of the repository will contain some important file, the first one is this file **README.md**
- **/NEW/** - this folder will contain new concept or update that needed to be refined
- **/BASIC/** - this folder contains refined and covered all the basic of JavaScript

## Repository Branches
Now in this repository we have 3 main branches

1. The **'master'** branch which being refined for anyone to follow learning JS along with me. This branch will not update everyday, it's regulary once or a few times a week, as I need it to be best refined. So if you want to read the latest update version please select the **'daily-update'** branch.

2. The **'daily-update'** branch, this branch will update dairy and refined as I could, if something seems not appropriate to commit the the 'master' branch, or need to fulfill to complete, it will stay here.

3. The **'test'** branch contain any new idea and learning, a lot of fragment, update many times a day, and something may remove before being merged to the **'dialy-update'** branch.

## Last but not least
This is my first solid learning on programming, and my real first GitHub repository also
so I will make it the best I can at the time, Any comments or suggestions on anything here are gladly welcome.

Thanks for coming. Enjoy learn JavaScript with me.
