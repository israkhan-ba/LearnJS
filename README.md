This is Learn JS project.

The purpose of this project is to track and share my learning about JavaScript including
1. What, Why and How of each things in JS that I had passed.
2. Share some ideas and concept for learning and developments.
3. List of things to involve with, doing, making, learning.
4. Anything around JS includes related subject and contexts.

To make sure that anything in this repository will be useful and help faster learning in JavaScript I will try something first before commit anything to the repository
as I am currently new to both JavaScript and GitHub and actually coding and development.
It will not always the actual thing I do but just thing that a little bit refined
and after I think something appropriate to commit, then I will.


I will work with this project by session (which will be 2 hours block of time)
I was intended to involved with it at least an hour everyday (Half session)
And commit updates before midnight everyday.

Some test will be fork first and commit to master later.
Some will not be commit as it's a long term test or parallel testing.

by the way this is not intended to be tutorials or something.
I just want to make a learning step for programming, refine it and share to you all.

This project will contains of 
- Text noted as Markdown as .md file
- Source JavaScript file named by purpose (Use my naming system which will update alogn with Learning tree [LEARNING-TREE.md] )
- Display of JavaScript test with HTML and other appropriate way.
