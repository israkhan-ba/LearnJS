# Errors

There are 2 main types of error

1. Syntax errors
- It's the typo error causing from writing or spelling codes incorrectly.  
Some error messages will appear in the console log. It's not hard to fix (but sometime hard to find.)
- Should be avoid by practice to type and spell correctly and slowly at first.

2. Logic errors
- Occurs when syntax is correct but the code was not work as it was intended to be.  
So program can runs successfully but gives incorrect results. It's harder to fix than syntax errors
and also harder to find 'cause there usually not showing error message in the console to direct to the source of the error.
