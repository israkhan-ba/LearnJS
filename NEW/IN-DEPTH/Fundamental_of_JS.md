# Fundamental of JavaScript

## Syntax

Syntax is a set of rules that defined how a program are constructed.  

Programming is **instructions** that listing well so a computer can be executed, and each program instructions are called generally called **statements**, So basically we can call any program is a set and sequence of statements working together

And we have **expressions**, which is any valid set of literals, variables, operators and expressions that evaluates to a single value.

In JavaScript **expressions** and **statements** are distinguished.    
For short, an **expression** produces a value and a **statement** performs an action.

### Statement

**Statements** are using to do something or produce some behavior and they will cause some side effects, so we can basically categorize statements by their kinds of side effect.

Basically each statements are seperated by a semicolon ( **;** )

### Expression

**Expression** intended to produces or evaluates some value without any side effect, the value may be a number, a string, or a logical value. Conceptually, there are two main type of expressions: those that assign a value to a variable, and those that simply have a value.

### Expression statement

If any expression that have produces side effect we will called them Expression statements.

Because **statements** can contain **expression** so wherever JavaScript expects a statement, we can also write an expression in to that but not a vice versa (we can't write a statement where JavaScript expects an expression)
